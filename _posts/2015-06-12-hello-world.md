Hello! This blog will serve as the main source for updates and news regarding the project. We will try our best to post weekly updates here on the status of InForm.

So who are we? We're Kylie and [Michael](http://mguida22.github.io), two students at the University of Colorado Boulder. The two of us are (soon to be) Juniors studying computer science.

What is InForm? Inform is a shirt that determines your body position and provides real-time feedback for activities such as yoga and lifting. The project came to life during Mark Gross's CSCI 4380 'Technology for Sport and Play' class at CU and we are currently continuing to research and improve upon our design.

The prototype we produced consists of an old underearmour t-shirt, conductive fabric and conductive thread. This all was fed into a microcontroller through a circuit we designed and data was passed to a computer to display the output.

The prototype we created during the last semester was enough to convince us that this idea is possible and got us excited. It showed that a concept that was only an idea five months ago could actually work, but there were many things we learned from the first design. The prototype is completely washable and has no electronics on the shirt itself, two of the goals we have wanted to keep in our design from the beginning. While this was a good way to show our idea, it fell short in accuracy and precision. The shirt would need to be calibrated to each user for a long time and wouldn't always provide the same feedback. So this summer we are planning to continue to research ways to improve upon the original prototype.

If you have any questions feel free to contact us at [kylie.dale@colorado.edu](mailto: kylie.dale@colorado.edu) and/or [michael.guida@colorado.edu](mailto: michael.guida@colorado.edu). We look forward to hearing any feedback.
