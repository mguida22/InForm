Hello! This blog will serve as the main source for updates and news regarding the project. We will try our best to post weekly updates to this blog.

So who are we? We're Kylie and [Michael](http://mguida22.github.io), two students at the University of Colorado Boulder. The two of us are (soon to be) Juniors studying computer science.

What is InForm? Inform is a shirt that determines your body position and provides real-time feedback for activities such as yoga and lifting. The project came to life during Mark Gross's CSCI 4380 'Technology for Sport and Play' class at CU and we are currently continuing to research and improve upon our design.

If you have any questions feel free to contact us at kylie.dale@colorado.edu and/or michael.guida@colorado.edu. We look forward to hearing any feedback.
