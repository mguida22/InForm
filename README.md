# InForm

> Currently a work in progress

This is the source for the [InForm website](http://mguida22.github.io/sensor-shirt). It will serve as the blog and public website for all things related to InForm as we progress with the project.

## Running and working Locally

Try to use [git flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) as much as possible to reduce the risk of breaking the live website. (Be careful with the setup of this, as `gh-pages` is the 'master' branch here.)

 - Clone repository
 - Switch to `gh-pages` branch
 - Ensure you have [bundler](http://bundler.io) installed on your machine
 - Run `bundle install` 
 - Run `jekyll serve --baseurl` (_start up_)
 - Navigate to localhost:4000 in your browser to see the site
 - Make changes, add post, etc. (_cash in_)
 - **Important** Rerun jekyll server check changes to verify changes
 - Commit changes (_sell out_)
